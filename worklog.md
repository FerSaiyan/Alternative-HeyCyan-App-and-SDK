# Tasker-Integration-Polish: AI/Gmail CI Tests — Handoff Worklog

Updated: 2026-08-23 (session 2, context limit reached — CONTINUE FROM "Next Steps")

## Mission

Make the new CI tests on branch `tasker-integration-polish` actually green — not "green because skipped". Specifically:

- `LocalAiTaskerChromeHilTest` — CyanBridge local model plans, Tasker/AutoInput drives Chrome against a deterministic web fixture, answer must be grounded in observed page facts.
- `LocalAgentEmailApprovalHilTest` — full real-email flow: Chrome research → summary → SendEmail queued as HIGH-risk → voice prompt → "maybe" gets clarification → literal "yes" approves → Tasker executes Gmail compose+Send → unique `CB-HIL-<ts>` subject must appear in Gmail. Recipient is the user's own account: `fernandosaiyan10@gmail.com` (user explicitly authorized real sends).

Both tests are gated by repo variables that are currently UNSET, so the last branch CI run (32656567419, both workflows success) skipped them. Default gates are green; the two optional layers have never run.

## Current Status

- Branch/worktree: `/tmp/opencode/HeyCyan-tasker-polish`, branch `tasker-integration-polish`, tracking `origin/tasker-integration-polish`, HEAD `617f8e7` + local UNCOMMITTED fixes (see below).
- Core 5-class HIL suite passes on emulator (`OK` per isolated class): fixture smoke, LocalAgent, AutoDiary, AiTaskerProfile, VisualDiary.
- Gmail on emulator `emulator-5554`: SIGNED IN as fernandosaiyan10@gmail.com; first-run screens completed (welcome tour GOT IT → TAKE ME TO GMAIL → notifications Allow → Meet Got it).
- Local model: **currently NOT installed** (deleted to free storage during APK reinstall). Must re-download via catalog UI before running either AI test (exact steps below).
- Web fixture: running on host port **18765** (8765 is occupied on this host by an LTFS server, pid 3381957 — that is also a real CI hazard, fixed in workflow, see below). Process: `nohup python3 tools/hil/serve_web_fixture.py --port 18765` (log `/tmp/opencode/tasker-polish-web-fixture-18765.log`). `adb reverse tcp:18765 tcp:18765` was set; re-run after any emulator restart. Chrome was prelaunched at `http://127.0.0.1:18765/` and marker `CYANBRIDGE_HIL_WEB_SEARCH_72941` verified visible, then HOME pressed.
- Build: `:app:assembleDebug :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest` green (needs both submodules initialized, see below).

## Uncommitted Fixes In The Worktree (all verified locally, need commit+push)

1. `.github/workflows/android-tasker-hil.yml` — fixture port collision fix:
   - Old code hard-coded port 8765; on this self-hosted runner `127.0.0.1:8765` is already used by `ltfs_web.py`, so `serve_web_fixture.py` died with `Address already in use` and the health check would pass against the WRONG server (it only checked HTTP 200).
   - New behavior: allocate an ephemeral host port, `echo port=... >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` (step id `web_fixture`), `export CYANBRIDGE_HIL_FIXTURE_PORT`, health check requires body marker `CYANBRIDGE_HIL_WEB_SEARCH_72941`, `adb reverse tcp:$port tcp:$port`, Chrome opened at `http://127.0.0.1:$port/`, "Reset Chrome fixture" and "Stop fixture" steps use `steps.web_fixture.outputs.port`.
2. `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/localmodels/device/DeviceCapabilityService.kt` — unit fix: replaced `GIB = 1024^3` divisor with `GIGABYTE = 1_000_000_000.0` (catalog `minRamGb`/`minStorageGb`/`sizeBytes` are decimal GB). Before this, a nominal 4 GB AVD reported 3.82 "GB" and every 4 GB-tier model was rejected ("RAM unsuitable: device has 3.8 GB, model needs at least 4.0 GB").
3. `android/CyanBridge/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/localmodels/catalog/LocalModelCatalog.kt` — qwen2.5-0.5b entry: `minStorageGb` 1.0 → 0.75 → **0.5** (with comment). Rationale: 0.5B model is ~0.47 GB; the 6 GB emulator data partition hovers around 0.5–0.8 GB free with Chrome/Gmail/Tasker resident, so a 1.0 GB post-install floor made the supported starter model permanently unloadable. Download headroom check (size+0.35 GB) is separate and still enforced.
4. `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/java/com/fersaiyan/cyanbridge/localmodels/download/LocalModelDownloadManager.kt` — downloader hardening: OkHttp client now `.protocols(listOf(Protocol.HTTP_1_1))` (Hugging Face large-file redirects intermittently reset HTTP/2 streams on Android: `StreamResetException: stream was reset: CANCEL`), and the retry loop catches `java.io.IOException` (covers StreamReset/Socket/DNS) instead of only SocketException+UnknownHostException. Verified: catalog download then completed ("Download complete", Status: ready).

Static checks pass: `python3 tools/hil/validate_tasker_profiles.py`, `bash -n tools/hil/*.sh`, `git diff --check`.

## Submodule Note (fresh worktrees)

This branch adds a second submodule. Both must be initialized or the build fails:
- `third_party/moonshine` @ 79b0217 (missing → `cmake.path ... doesn't exist`)
- `android/CyanBridge/app/src/main/myvu-upstream` @ 66ec6f6 (missing → dozens of `Unresolved reference 'myvu'`)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
git -C third_party/moonshine lfs pull --include="core/speaker-embedding-model-data.cpp,core/third-party/onnxruntime/lib/android/arm64/libonnxruntime.so"
```

CI is fine (workflow checks out submodules recursively + LFS pull); this is only for local worktrees.

## Reproduction Trail (what was observed, in order)

1. `LocalAgentEmailApprovalHilTest` with `CYANBRIDGE_HIL_EMAIL_SEND=true` → fails safely at prereq: "No CyanBridge local model is installed/selected for the email automation HIL" (no email sent).
2. Imported the 0.5B GGUF via app UI (Import model file → Downloads → pick file). Import path has NO capability gate, but load-time gate then crashed the test app: `RAM unsuitable ... 3.8 GB` → fixed by decimal-GB change (#2).
3. After #2, load gate: `Not enough free storage. Need about 1.00 GB` (custom imports fall back to hardcoded min 4.0 RAM/1.0 storage in `LocalChatSessionManager.ensureModelLoaded` capabilityEntry) → decided to use the CATALOG download instead (catalog floor now 0.5).
4. Catalog download failed twice with `stream was reset: CANCEL` (HTTP/2) → fixed by #4; then downloaded successfully via the app UI.
5. `LocalAiTaskerChromeHilTest` then reached model load and failed only on the storage floor (0.75) → lowered to 0.5 (#3). APK replacement then hit `INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE`; recovered by deleting `files/local_models` via `run-as` + `cmd package trim-caches 2G` + reinstall (Success).
6. **Stopped here**: about to re-download the model via catalog UI and rerun the local-AI test.

## Next Steps (in order)

1. **Re-install + re-download model** (emulator `emulator-5554`):
   - APKs are already installed (patched build). If needed: `bash tools/hil/install.sh emulator-5554` from the polish worktree.
   - Free storage first if low: `adb shell cmd package trim-caches 2G`; check `adb shell df -k /data` (need ≥ ~1.2 GB free for download headroom 0.4+0.35 GB; after install ~0.5 GB is enough to LOAD).
   - UI recipe (coordinates are for this 1080x2424 AVD, verified working):
     1. `adb shell monkey -p com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge 1` (launch; dismiss any permission dialog with Allow at ~(540,1325))
     2. Tap Settings tab: (980,2190)
     3. Swipe up: `input swipe 540 1900 540 700 500`
     4. Tap "Configure local models" row parent (text bounds ~[147,1140..1282]; tap ~(300,1193) — re-dump `uiautomator` and compute from `text="Configure local models"` if unsure)
     5. In Local models screen: tap "Curated catalog" header to expand (~(500,1157) or wherever the header is; verify `Collapse Curated catalog` appears)
     6. Swipe down: `input swipe 540 2200 540 700 600` until `text="Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct (Q4_K_M)"` visible with `Device suitable`
     7. Tap its **Download** button — it is the LEFT button of the pair, e.g. bounds [84,1335][529,1461] → tap (300,1387). (The right button is "Info".)
     8. Wait ~90 s; verify `Status: ready` and "Download complete". If "stream was reset" appears, the HTTP/1.1 fix isn't installed — rebuild/reinstall first.
   - Fallback (if catalog download keeps failing): `adb push /tmp/opencode/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf /sdcard/Download/` then app → Local models → "Import model file" → Downloads → tap the file card (left card, e.g. (300,1000)). Caveat: imported-custom models use hardcoded floors (4.0 RAM/1.0 storage) in `LocalChatSessionManager` — with the decimal-GB fix RAM passes (4.1 GB), but storage needs ≥1.0 GB free; trim caches or free space first. Catalog download is preferred.
2. **Run local-AI test** (fixture must be up):
   ```bash
   nohup python3 tools/hil/serve_web_fixture.py --port 18765 >/tmp/opencode/tasker-polish-web-fixture-18765.log 2>&1 &
   adb -s emulator-5554 reverse tcp:18765 tcp:18765
   adb -s emulator-5554 shell am force-stop com.android.chrome
   adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d 'http://127.0.0.1:18765/' -p com.android.chrome
   sleep 3; adb -s emulator-5554 shell input keyevent KEYCODE_HOME
   CYANBRIDGE_HIL_LOCAL_AI=true bash tools/hil/run_instrumentation.sh emulator-5554 hardware com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge.hil.LocalAiTaskerChromeHilTest
   ```
   Test must answer with "37", "amber", "cyanbridge", "tasker" (Borealis fixture facts) and end observed on Chrome article marker `CYANBRIDGE_HIL_WEB_ARTICLE_72941`. Debug with `adb logcat -s TaskerLocalAgent LocalChatSession LocalModelDownload` and `run-as com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge cat shared_prefs/local_agent_prefs.xml` (status/last_error). Planner is Qwen 0.5B on CPU — steps are slow; BRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS=60 s per step, test budget 6 min.
3. **Run the real-email test** (user authorized; sends exactly one self-email per run):
   ```bash
   adb -s emulator-5554 shell am force-stop com.android.chrome
   adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d 'http://127.0.0.1:18765/' -p com.android.chrome
   sleep 2; adb -s emulator-5554 shell input keyevent KEYCODE_HOME
   CYANBRIDGE_HIL_EMAIL_SEND=true bash tools/hil/run_instrumentation.sh emulator-5554 hardware com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge.hil.LocalAgentEmailApprovalHilTest
   ```
   Preconditions inside the test: NO pre-existing pending actions (assert fails otherwise — resolve via app Pending Actions UI if needed), provider becomes LOCAL_AGENT (or already PRO_SUBSCRIPTION), `RemoteOpenAiPrefs.isActive` false, model installed. Replies "maybe"/"yes" are injected textually via `LocalAgentController.replyToApproval` (no real mic needed), but the voice session still speaks via TTS and listens (silence tolerated; external reply wins).
4. **Fix whatever the tests expose** (product bugs, keep changes minimal), then:
   - `python3 tools/hil/validate_tasker_profiles.py && bash -n tools/hil/*.sh && git diff --check`
   - `./gradlew --no-daemon :app:testDebugUnitTest :shared:portabilityTest`
   - Core suite (5 classes) still green.
5. **Commit** the four files listed above (+ any new fixes) on `tasker-integration-polish` and push. Suggested message themes: fixture port collision + marker health check; decimal-GB capability units; 0.5B storage floor; HTTP/1.1 + IOException retry for model downloads.
6. **Enable CI layers** (requires repo admin; `gh variable list` currently shows NO CYANBRIDGE_* vars):
   ```bash
   gh variable set CYANBRIDGE_HIL_ENABLE_EMAIL_SEND --body true -R FerSaiyan/Alternative-HeyCyan-App-and-SDK
   gh variable set CYANBRIDGE_HIL_ENABLE_LOCAL_AI  --body true -R FerSaiyan/Alternative-HeyCyan-App-and-SDK   # optional but recommended
   ```
   If you cannot set vars, ask the user to add them in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables.
7. **Verify CI**: push → watch `Android Tasker HIL` run; the previously "skipped" steps (Prepare persistent emulator for AI automation HIL, Prepare deterministic Chrome fixture, Run CyanBridge local AI through Tasker and Chrome, Reset Chrome fixture, Run approved Gmail self-send HIL) must now RUN and PASS. Note the runner's persistent AVD is presumably this same machine's AVD (self-hosted homelab runner) — local emulator state (Gmail sign-in, installed model, Tasker entitlements) IS the CI state; keep it healthy, never wipe.
8. Update this worklog with final results.

## Operational Notes

- ADB on this API 37 emulator drops constantly (`error: device offline/not found`). Pattern that works: `adb kill-server; adb start-server; adb -s emulator-5554 wait-for-device` before each batch; retry failed taps once.
- `run_instrumentation.sh` already: dismisses the 16 KB compat dialog, splits comma-lists into one process per class, and recovers offline emulators via `tools/hil/start_emulator.sh` (cold boot, userdata preserved).
- Storage is the recurring constraint (6 GB /data, ~80–92% used). Recovery recipe that worked: `adb shell am force-stop com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge; adb exec-out run-as com.fersaiyan.cyanbridge sh -c 'rm -rf files/local_models'; adb shell cmd package trim-caches 2G; adb install -r -d <apk>`.
- Gmail/Tasker/AutoInput state, Google account, and accessibility grants must never be wiped (`pm clear`, `-wipe-data` are forbidden).
- The email test's Tasker side executes the approved SendEmail through the Local Agent Tasker project (`android/CyanBridge/tasker/CyanBridge_LocalAgent_Tasker.prj.xml`); if execution fails, check `TaskerExecutionBackend.execute` results in the pending-action record and the Tasker run log. The planner prompt requires a second observation proving compose is gone before finishing.
- Repo variables/secret context: `META_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret exists; `CYANBRIDGE_HIL_*` vars do not (as of this writing).

## Constraints (unchanged)

- No subagents. No credential exposure. No billing/entitlement bypass (Tasker/AutoInput entitlements were legitimately restored earlier via the user's own AutoApps purchases).
- Real email ONLY to `fernandosaiyan10@gmail.com`, one per test run, unique `CB-HIL-<ts>` subject, body labeled as deterministic fixture data.
- Do not `pm clear` CyanBridge/Gmail/Tasker; do not wipe the AVD; do not force-push without approval.
